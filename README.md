# A Library & Client implementation of [`luarocks`](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks)

Rocks serves as an application for:
- Installing and managing rocks
- Creating Lua projects with dependencies, build scripts and desired Lua versions
- Creating and publishing your own rocks
- Embedding rock manipulation logic into your own application

> [!NOTE]
> This project does not aim to supercede `luarocks` itself.
> Rather, it is designed to complement luarocks and retain backwards compatibility where
  possible.

# Usage

```sh
rocks <command> <options>
```
